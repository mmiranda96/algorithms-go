## Description
This repository includes common data structures and algorithms.
## Objective
This repository has two main purposes:
1. Show the data structures and algorithms fundamentals, as well as a concrete implementation.
2. Serve as a guide to the Go language.
## Algorithms/structures
- Linked list
- Stack (linked list implementation)
- Queue (double stack implementation)
- Infix operation evaluation
- Sorting:
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
    - Quick sort (randomized pivot)
    - Bubble sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Radix sort (using queue sorting)
    - Bucket sort (using insertion sort for buckets)
    - Counting sort
